# Introduction

The [DataBiosphere][] project includes a vision

![schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vjcitn/AnVILTNU/main/databiosfig.jpg)

of which AnVIL/Terra forms a part.

[DataBiosphere]: https://www.databiosphere.org

The [terra-notebook-utils][ python modules is described as a "Python
API and CLI providing utilities for working with DRS objects, VCF
files, and the Terra notebook environment."

[terra-notebook-utils]: https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-notebook-utils

This R package aims to provide a regulated interface between R and
terra-notebook-utils for use in AnVIL.

By "regulated" we mean that the entire python ecosystem used to work
with terra-notebook-utils is defined in a virtual environment.  We
make some exceptions for the sake of demonstration, but, for example,
the `drs_access` command uses a very particular interface between R
and python, using the Bioconductor [basilisk][] package.

# Basic concepts

## Installing in an AnVIL workspace, Oct 2022

As of 10/2022, AnVILTNU exists in a github repository.  To install and
use properly with R in AnVIL

- ensure there is a .Renviron file in the home folder with content
  `PIP_USER=false`
- use `BiocManager::install("vjcitn/AnVILTNU")`
- verify that `library(AnVILTNU); example(drs_access)` produces a
  signed URL

## Probing available features

Once installation has succeeded, we use basilisk-mediated commands
defined in the AnVILTNU package to probe or use terra-notebook-utils.
We can get the names of all modules available after importing
terra-notebook-utils.

```{r lk1}
library(AnVILTNU)
tnu_top()
```

We can also retrieve the help content for the python modules
subordinate to terra-notebook-utils.

```{r lk2}
tnu_help()
```

## Generating signed URLS

The argument to `drs_access` is the google storage location of a CRAI
file.

```{r lk3}
uri <- "drs://dg.4503:dg.4503/17141a26-90e5-4160-9c20-89202b369431"
if (tnu_workspace_ok())
    substr(drs_access(uri), 1, 80)
```

More features related to DRS become available when basilisk interfaces
are added to this package.

```{r lk4}
tnu_drs_help()
```
