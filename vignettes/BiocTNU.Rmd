# Introduction

The [DataBiosphere][] project includes a vision

![schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vjcitn/AnVILTNU/main/databiosfig.jpg)

of which AnVIL/Terra forms a part.

[DataBiosphere]: https://www.databiosphere.org

The [terra-notebook-utils][] python modules is described as a "Python
API and CLI providing utilities for working with DRS objects, VCF
files, and the Terra notebook environment."

[terra-notebook-utils]: https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-notebook-utils

This R package aims to provide a regulated interface between R and
terra-notebook-utils for use in AnVIL.

By "regulated" we mean that the entire python ecosystem used to work
with terra-notebook-utils is defined in a virtual environment.  We
make some exceptions for the sake of demonstration, but, for example,
the `drs_access` command uses a very particular interface between R
and python, using the Bioconductor [basilisk][] package.

# Basic concepts

## Installing in an AnVIL workspace, July 2023

As of 07/2023, AnVILTNU exists in a github repository.  To install and
use properly with R in AnVIL, make sure that [basilisk][] is installed
and at least at version 1.13.1; one way to do this is to install from
the GitHub repository.

```{r basilisk, eval = FALSE}
test <-
    "basilisk" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) &&
    packageVersion("basilisk") > "1.13.1"
if (!test)
    BiocManager::install("LTLA/basilisk")
```

Install the [AnVILTNU][] package with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("vjcitn/AnVILTNU")
```

Complete the installation by running the simple help function
`AnVILTNU::tnu_help()`. This will install the necessary Python version
and dependencies.

Basic tests of the installation include

```{r}
## test package installation and basic configuration; should return
## the namespace/name of the current AnVIL workspace.
AnVILTNU::tnu_workspace()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## test basilisk / Python installation. Should present a help page
## summarizing use
AnVILTNU::tnu_help()
```

### Troubleshooting installations

- `tnu_help()` fails during initial conda installation with 'error
  code 137'. This occurs when the instance does not have sufficient
  memory for basilisk conda installation. A 4 CPU / 15 GB instance has
  been sufficient during testing.

- `drs_access()` fails with a message like

    ```
    Error: terra_notebook_utils.drs.DRSResolutionError: Unexpected
    response while resolving DRS URI. Expected status 200,
    got 500. Received error contacting Bond. The server encountered an
    internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the
    server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.
    ```

  This can be because Terra / AnVIL 'external entities' are not
  configured ('Hamburger' - User - Profile - External Entities' for
  access to the requested entity. The examples on `?drs_access`
  require NHLBI BioData Catalyst access. At time of writing a bug in
  Terra requires Kids First DRC access. It doesn't hurt to enable
  NHGRI AnVIL Data Commons.

## Probing available features

Once installation has succeeded, we use basilisk-mediated commands
defined in the AnVILTNU package to probe or use terra-notebook-utils.
We can get the names of all modules available after importing
terra-notebook-utils.

```{r lk1, message = FALSE}
library(AnVILTNU)
tnu_top()
```

We can also retrieve the help content for the python modules
subordinate to terra-notebook-utils.

```{r lk2}
tnu_help()
```

## Generating signed URLS

The argument to `drs_access` is the google storage location of a CRAI
file.

```{r lk3}
uri <- "drs://dg.4503:dg.4503/17141a26-90e5-4160-9c20-89202b369431"
if (tnu_workspace_ok())
    substr(drs_access(uri), 1, 80)
```

## Copying DRS URLS

`drs_copy` is used to copy DRS URIs to a local file or to a google bucket. The
function requries a destination where the URLS should be copied to.

```{r lk4}
uris <- c(
    "drs://dg.4503/15fdd543-9875-4edf-8bc2-22985473dab6",
    "drs://dg.4503/3c861ec6-d810-4058-b851-c0b19dd5933e",
    "drs://dg.4503/374a0ad9-b3a2-47f3-8860-5083b302e478"
)
if (tnu_workspace_ok())
    drs_copy(uris, tempfile())
```

## Generating information about DRS

There are a couple functions available that will provide information about the
DRS URLS provided. `drs_head` will query the DRS object and print the set number
of bytes while `drs_info` will return information about the DRS URIs.

```{r lk5}
if (tnu_workspace_ok()) {
    drs_info(uris)
    drs_head(uris, 100)
}
```

# Firecloud functionality

Using the firecloud python module allows users to get information about tables
within their AnVIL workspace via the api. Below we demonstrate how a user can
utilize these functions via R / basilisk.

## Table information

Within this package there are two function that display general table
information. `tables()` displays a tibble with 4 columns; table name,
row count, column count, and column names. `table()` requires a
specific table name and will display a tibble of the information
within that table.

```{r lk6}
if (tnu_workspace_ok()) {
    tables()
    table("test_table")
}
```

## Additon or deletion of table information

A user may wish to upload a new table or add rows to a current table. The
function `table_upload` will allow the user to add information to a table within
their AnVIL workspace. We also provide deletion functionality which allows the
user the ability to delete single or multiple rows from a given table.

```{r lk7}
if (tnu_workspace_ok()) {
    mycars <- head(mtcars) |>
        dplyr::as_tibble(rownames = "model_id") |>
        dplyr::mutate(model_id = gsub(" ", "_", model_id))

    tables()
    table("model")
    table_upload(mycars)

    table_delete_values("model", "Mazda_RX4")
    table("model")
}
```

## Shiny representation of tables

`tables_gadget` creates a shiny app that displays information about
the available tables in the workspace. A user could select a certain
table and on exit it will return that table within their R session as
a tibble.

```{r lk8}
if (tnu_workspace_ok())
    tables_gadget()
```

# Advanced use

The next section will demonstrate how to access other functions within
the `firecloud` module that may not be a part of this package. The
first thing to do is to get a basilisk session started. Then we will
import the module of interest, in this example it will be
`firecloud`. Using `reticulate::py_help()` displays the help page for
the available functions.  Then you can just run the function of
interest using the specified arguments.

```{r lk9}
if (tnu_workspace_ok()) {
    proc <- basiliskStart(bsklenv)
    firecloud <- reticulate::import("firecloud")
    reticulate::py_help(firecloud$api)
    response <- firecloud$api$list_entity_types(tnu_workspace_namespace(),
        tnu_workspace_name())
    read.delim(text = response$text, sep = "\t", header = FALSE)
    basiliskStop(proc)
}
```

We utilized `rjsoncons::jmespath` and `jsonlite::fromJSON` to make the
data more presentable within a tibble. This might be something of
interest to users who want to expand on other functions from the
modules used within this package.

# Session information

```{r lk10}
sessionInfo()
```
