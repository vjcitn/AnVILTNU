Description: The 'terra-notebook-utils' Python module
    <https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-notebook-utils> provides
    an interface to Terra / AnVIL notebook functionality, in
    particular DRS resolution to signed URLs. AnVILTNU provides an
    interface to the Python module, providing the R user with a
    familiar experience. AnVILTNU uses the `basilisk` system
    <https://bioconductor.org/packages/basilisk> to ensure a
    reproducible Python environment independent of other Python
    installations on the user system.
