# AnVILTNU

The [DataBiosphere][] project includes a vision

of which AnVIL/Terra forms a part.

The [terra-notebook-utils][] Python modules is described as a "Python
API and CLI providing utilities for working with DRS objects, VCF
files, and the Terra notebook environment."

This R package aims to provide a regulated interface between R and
terra-notebook-utils for use in AnVIL.  By "regulated" we mean that
the entire python ecosystem used to work with terra-notebook-utils is
defined in a virtual environment.

The AnVILTNU [package vignette][] provides essential instructions for
installation and troubleshooting.
